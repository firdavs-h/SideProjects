A New Look For The Fashion Industry?

If you've been looking at the fall fashion and lifestyle magazines that have been 
published over the past few weeks, you'll notice that a lot of the covers feature
 Black people. That, says Robin Givhan — longtime fashion writer for the Washington 
 Post and now a senior critic-at-large for the paper — is no coincidence.

The fashion world, like many industries and institutions, is experiencing a reckoning 
on race. Condé Nast, the 800-pound gorilla of lifestyle and luxury publishing, was 
shaken several months ago when Adam Rapoport, the editor of one of its flagship 
publications, Bon Appetit, stepped down after his staff accused him of racist and 
bullying behavior. Then it was Anna Wintour's turn; the editor in chief of Vogue 
and artistic director of Condé Nast was taken to task for not being racially inclusive — 
on her pages and with her staff. The luxury Italian fashion houses Gucci and Prada were 
criticized for producing designs that evoked blackface minstrelsy. And so on.
The September issues of glossy magazines, even ones that aren't strictly fashion, have 
always been a big deal. This year, a lot of different covers featured Black people, and 
it feels like it's happening all at once. What's happening here?

In many ways, I think British Vogue has really been a leader in this regard. Edward 
Enninful has been at the helm of the magazine for around three years. When he took on 
that position, as the first Black person to take on that role, he went in with a very 
intentional desire to make British Vogue more diverse. That was part of his mission 
statement. And he also wanted to maintain the same aspirational, fantasy aspect of the 
magazine. He simply wanted to invite more people into that fantasy.

And I do think that the successes that he has had with the covers from the very beginning
 did sort of spark a greater sense of diversity on the covers of other magazines and 
 sister publications. But I do think that we take what Edward was already doing, and 
 then you couple it with the changing cultural ground today. In many ways, it's almost 
 sort of inconceivable that you would continue in the same old ways. It would be an 
 almost sort of aggressive denial of the way in which the world is changing, not to reflect that on the covers of magazines.

Harper's Bazaar just appointed its first Black woman as its editor in chief. InStyle 
Magazine had Zendaya on the cover, who was styled by a Black stylist, Law Roach, who 
brought in a whole village of Black creatives to work with him on that cover. And so I 
do think that it's a moment when the soil has really been tilled and it's this 
opportunity for these so many people who have always been there and who have always
 been working in fashion to step sort of out of the chorus and take center stage.

How cyclical you think this is or maybe this is different from previous iterations of 
this? I can remember as far back as the '70s when there were people saying, "We need 
more Black models," and then it would go away. But it would come back again, especially
 in those times when you would have designers whose entire lineup was pretty alabaster. 
 But this feels a lot bigger than that.
I don't know the answer to the question of what lasting changes that this moment might 
create. But I do know that, for years, there has been a focus on a more diverse range 
of models, both on the runway and fashion editorials, as well as in advertising. And if
 you look at the changes in that particular area of the fashion industry over the last 
 five to 10 years, it's dramatic. I think some would argue that now, if you looked at a
  runway show or an editorial that didn't have some element of diversity, it would be
   the odd duck out. It would be notable and people would be talking about it. Diversity 
   on the runway is much more part of the norm.

This, I think, is moving beyond that to the parts of the fashion industry that the
 public doesn't really see, but are arguably the even more influential parts of the
  industry because it gets into who's an atelier, who's in charge of the design 
  aesthetic, who's in charge of the creative inspiration, who's in charge of the money 
  and the financing, who sits on the boards of directors, who's writing the stories, 
  who's taking the photographs, who's making the decisions about who goes on the cover 
  of a magazine.

I think some have been more visible in the callout for this than others. Anna Wintour 
has certainly gotten her own share of attention for the need for more diversity at 
Vogue and at Condé Nast. You spoke to her after this big callout. Did she have some 
sense that this change is inevitable and that she needs to be ahead of it, rather than
 being pulled in its wake?

I think that at this point, she isn't ahead of it. She's playing catch up! And this 
is someone who has been at the helm of Vogue for more than 30 years. She's artistic 
director of Condé Nast and is charged with overseeing a vast array of magazines.
 I think that she certainly could have listened to some of the the outpouring on 
 social media and made an announcement that it was time for a new generation to step
  forward and she was stepping down from Vogue. But instead, she made the decision to 
  plant a flag and not let this be the final chapter of her legacy. So there definitely 
  are changes that are being implemented at Condé Nast. I think one of the most helpful 
  is the return of the internship program at Condé Nast, but this time a paid 
  internship program.

The internships have normally not been paid. And so they've been the purview of people
 who could afford to take them, right?

Even the current editor in chief of Teen Vogue, who is Black, talks about how, you know, 
she was an intern at Condé Nast and had to work two jobs in addition to her internship 
in order to survive in New York during that time. So the fact that they will be paid 
will certainly help broaden the different kinds of people who can afford to participate
 in them. But I will say that Anna does seem to be very aware that, you know, social 
 media taketh and then social media taketh some more. Social media does not say, Oh, 
 that negative assessment that we had a year ago? You fixed it, congratulations! It's 
 all good. But I think she does realize that she's on the hot seat. And she said that if
  a year from now there's another conversation and there's no evidence of change, or 
  significant movement and progress, that she is responsible for that failure.
